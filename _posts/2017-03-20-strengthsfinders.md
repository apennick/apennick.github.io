title: Strengthsfinders
---
In 2014, my company asked that we complete the Strengthsfinders (SF) questionnaire prior to a big team meeting. I've always enjoyed taking different personality or career or preferences surveys, but this one stuck with me like my Myers-Briggs type (ENFJ). What you're supposed to get out of SF is the idea that maximizing strengths is likely to produce better results than attempting to change weaknesses: focusing on the positive rather than fixating on negative qualities. What I found most profound, however, was the analysis of and validation for my choices and motivations.

My top five strengths are listed and described--by "them" and "me" in descending order.

*Relator*
>Them: "...enjoy close relationships with others. They find deep satisfaction in working hard with friends to achieve a goal."
>Me: As I've gotten older I've felt myself becoming more introverted in many ways--relishing and requiring alone time--while also seeking out many and varied group connections. I work remotely with a great team that lives all across the country. We connect via chat and video calls during work and through social media outside of work. We have more inside jokes than I can count. I'm in three book clubs because I need to read (alone), and I need to talk about it (club). I manage the school book fair and chaperone field trips. 

*Individualization*
>Them: "...are intrigued with the unique qualities of each person. They have a gift for figuring out how people who are different can work together productively."
>Me: The fact that "relator"--connecting with groups--and "individualization"--connecting with individuals--are my top two strengths was intriguing to me
The collaborative nature of coding paired with the opportunity for putting my head down to solve a problem appeals to me greatly.

*Learner*
>Them: "...have a great desire to learn and want to continuously improve. In particular, the process of learning, rather than the outcome, excites them."
>Me:

*Responsibility*
>Them: "...take psychological ownership of what they say they will do. They are committed to stable values such as honesty and loyalty."
>Me: 

*Achiever*
>Them: "...have a great deal of stamina and work hard. They take great satisfaction from being busy and productive."
>Me:
