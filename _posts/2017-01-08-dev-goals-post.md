title: My Pathway to learning WebDev
---
My dad was an early adopter and I loved playing games on our Apple IIGS--the first computer I remember having at around age 6. We had Macs at school too and played Oregon Trail, Number Munchers, Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?--all the greats. I learned to type with Mavis Beacon and saved papers in high school and college on 3.5" floppy discs. The internet wasn't a constant presence until college: we had dial up throughout high school and the T1 lines at Fordham University were a revelation: Napster so fast and for hours on end. 

I got my fifth e-mail address at my first "real" job--I still have that e-mail address and still work at that company. I've enjoyed most of the work and most of the people which, I think, is more than most can say. I've learned many things of both the difficult and easy varieties. I've worked in several roles and experienced many new directions and initiatives and structures and reorganizations. I've gone from managing my responsibilities primarily via my own documents and spreadsheets on a desktop in an office to working remotely in the cloud via various internal and contracted apps and systems.

As I said, I've enjoyed my various jobs at my company but felt somewhat like I fell into it and that it wasn't what I was supposed to DO for the rest of my career. I managed a team of part-time teachers for 7 years and while I enjoyed some of that, I've' found that I prefer working independently and with peers rather than having the bulk of my job be getting others to do their jobs. We've also gotten to a place where apps and systems aren't just for sales and marketing anymore. We have systems built for those of us that work on delivering the "product" that is teaching and tutoring. Training is done asynchronously online and documents are created to be shared and modified rather than hoarded in the vacuum of any one person's fiefdom.

My current role has me engaging in supporting candidates, new hires, managers, and teams via process execution and revision.
